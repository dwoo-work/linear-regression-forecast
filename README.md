# Linear Regression Forecast (LRF)

This will demonstrate to you how to perform Linear Regression Forecast (LRF) on sales data, to predict future sales values based on the pastn using Python.

There are different kinds of forecasting that can be performed:

- Supply Forecasting: This allows you to analyse your suppliers, to determine the amount of products that can be ordered and delivered in a specific timeframe.
- Demand Forecasting: This allows you to analyse your customers, to determine the demands in a specific timeframe. This helps to prepare a suitable volume of stock, such that it can fill up the customer orders, and yet not wasting extra time and effort.
- Price Forecasting: This allows you to analyse the price of your products, to help observe how a change of price can affect customer demand.

By using LRF, we are performing a quantitative forecast, which makes use of the existing data available.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install:

- pandas: to perform data administration by pulling in .csv or .xlsx files.
- numpy: to perform data manipulation by establishing arrays.
- seaborn: to perform data visualisation based on matplotlib.
- matplotlib: to create static, animated, and interactive visualisations.

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install seaborn
pip install matplotlib
```

## Sample Dataset

For this, you can download the sales_data_sample_utf8.csv file from the source folder, which is located [here](https://github.com/dwoo-work/MultiCriteriaABC.Analysis/blob/main/src).

Ensure that the file is in CSV UTF-8 format, to avoid UnicodeDecodeError later on.
